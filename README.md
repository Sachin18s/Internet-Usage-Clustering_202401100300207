Overview
The "Internet Usage Clustering" project aims to analyze and group users based on their internet usage patterns using the K-Means clustering algorithm. By clustering users with similar behavior, this project helps identify distinct user segments that can be useful for tasks such as targeted advertising, optimizing internet services, and personalizing user experiences.

Features
Data Preprocessing: Handles missing values, scales the features, and prepares the data for clustering.

Clustering with K-Means: Applies the K-Means algorithm to cluster users based on features like daily usage hours, site categories visited, and sessions per day.

Elbow Method: Uses the Elbow Method to determine the optimal number of clusters by plotting inertia values for different values of k.

Data Visualization: Visualizes the clustering results in a 2D scatter plot to easily observe user segments.
